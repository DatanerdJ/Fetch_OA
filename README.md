### Project Overview
This exercise encompasses several key aspects of data engineering and analysis using unstructured JSON data from Fetch Rewards. The focus is on enhancing data integrity, enabling efficient querying, and communicating insights effectively.

#### Part 1: Data Modeling [Relational Data Model - Part 1](https://github.com/DatanerdJ/Fetch_OA/wiki/RelationalDataModel-Part1.pdf)
- **Objective**: Develop a robust Snowflake Schema for structured relational data modeling..
- **Outcome**: Clear diagram and SQL schema for users, brands, and receipts dimensions.

#### Part 2: Querying Data
- **Objective**: Address business queries using SQL.

#### Part 3: Data Quality Assessment
- **Objective**: Evaluate and improve data quality.
- **Approach**: Utilize Python for exploration, focusing on identifying and resolving issues like missing values, duplicates, and inconsistent data.
- **Findings**: Notable findings include missing data across various fields, duplicate entries in user records, and discrepancies in receipt status distribution.

#### Part 4: Stakeholder Communication[Email for Stakeholder](https://github.com/DatanerdJ/Fetch_OA/wiki/emailforstakeholder.pdf)
- **Objective**: Communicate findings effectively to stakeholders.
- **Content**: Detailed email discussing data modeling process, identified data quality issues, and recommendations for optimizing data assets and query performance.

### Areas of Improvement
1. **Enhanced Data Integrity**: Implement strategies to handle missing data more effectively and ensure consistency in data across different sources.
   
2. **Advanced Query Optimization**: Explore indexing strategies and query optimization techniques to enhance performance, especially as data scales.
